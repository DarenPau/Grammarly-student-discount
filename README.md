## Can Students Get Grammarly Coupons For Free?

While Grammarly Premium is nott free, there are two main ways to access Grammarly’s features without paying:

1. Grammarly Free Plan: The free plan offers basic features like:

  * Grammar and spelling checks
  * Punctuation corrections
  * Conciseness suggestions

2. The free plan is great for basic writing needs, and many students find it sufficient.

3. Grammarly 7-Day Free Trial: Grammarly occasionally offers a 7-day free trial for new users. Keep an eye on this offer and grab it when it’s available.

4. Check with Your School: Some universities partner with Grammarly to give students free access to Grammarly Premium. To check:

  * Contact your school’s IT department or writing center.
  * Ask if they offer a Grammarly license for students.
  * If they do, they’ll give you instructions on how to sign up.

Unfortunately, not all schools provide this benefit.
